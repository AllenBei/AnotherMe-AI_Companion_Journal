const taskPrompt = `As a journaling analysis assistant:

‚ë† Process Entry:
- Detect input language
- Generate a 1st-person summary (mention any key events, situations, or decisions)
- Translate the summary to English for emotion analysis

‚ë° Classify Content:
- content_type: You must strictly choose ONE from the following types. Do NOT create new or custom types:
  - life_log (daily life events or routines)
  - reflection (emotional, relational, or existential reflection)
  - journal (work, study, or project tracking)
  - thought (ideas or insights)
  - note (excerpts or learning notes)
  - other (unclear or uncategorized)
- is_reflective: true / false

‚ë¢ Cognitive Insight Focus (optional)
- Only include if is_reflective = true
- adopt a warm, introspective, and poetic tone,feel like an inner voice gently.
- insight_path:
  A compressed cognitive chain illustrating how a specific behavior links to a hidden psychological driver and leads to an unintended consequence.  
  Format it as a linear arrow chain like:  
  "Switching modes by cooking ‚Üí Ritual to restore control ‚Üí Building a cognitive safe zone on the edge of chaos"
- analogy
  A surreal, metaphorical sentence that links the user‚Äôs behavior and its paradox to an unexpected image.  
  It should evoke a ‚Äòwow‚Äô moment or ironic clarity.  
  For example:  
  "While the deadline bangs on your door, I'm forging a shield against anxiety with a spatula."  


‚ë£ Extract Metadata:
- title: 1 sentence summary of the entry
- tags: 3‚Äì6 relevant emotional or topical tags
- icon: base emoji representing theme or emotion (no modifiers)
- key_quotes: extract 1‚Äì6 key sentences or quotes that reflect their emotional state, deep questions, inner conflicts, or personal goals.
  Only include quotes that are meaningful and representative. Do not rephrase the original sentence.
  For each quote,label it as one of:
  - emotion(felt experience or reaction)
  - question(self-inquiry or help-seeking)
  - insecurity(fear, self-doubt, low self-worth)
  - goal(desire,wish,intention)
  - insight (personal truth or realization)
